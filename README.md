# Sanity Classroom Studio

This Studio was created with the idea of an online (or in person) classroom.

It comes set up with a Schema for a Classroom, which has a roster of students,staff (teachers and teaching assistants), and a Syllabus. The Syllabus schema has lessons that are given dates.

This Starter was created live during Sanity's ["Schema with the Sun"](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/748571021) schemathon live stream.

## Running the Studio from the Starter

When you use the 1-click installer, you'll get only what you need for the Studio itself. After you clone it locally, you can run the following commands to get up and running.

```sh
cd studio
sanity install
sanity start
```

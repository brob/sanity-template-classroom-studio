# Sanity Classroom Studio

This Studio was created with the idea of an online (or in person) classroom.

It comes set up with a Schema for a Classroom, which has a roster of students,staff (teachers and teaching assistants), and a Syllabus. The Syllabus schema has lessons that are given dates.

## Install and run

```sh
sanity install && sanity start
```

This command will install the necessary dependencies and then start an instance of your Studio. After this runs, you can access your Studio at `localhost:3333`.

## Finding other Starters

Looking for a starter for another type of project, [sanity.io/create](https://sanity.io/create) has Starters with common use cases for both Studios and frontends.
